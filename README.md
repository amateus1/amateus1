# 👋 Hi, I'm Hernan (AI) Mateus

🚀 DevOps Product Owner | Solutions Architect | AI-Driven Consultant

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m a hands-on technology leader and consultant with over 15 years of global experience helping enterprises accelerate their digital transformation. I specialize in designing and implementing AI-driven DevOps strategies that unlock agility, scale, and innovation.

Currently, I'm deep in the world of Agentic AI—engineering autonomous software development teams using multi-role AI agents to write, test, and deploy production-grade applications.

Whether it’s cloud automation in China’s regulated regions or embedding AI into traditional delivery pipelines, I bring a unique blend of strategic vision and hands-on delivery to every engagement.
